# Classes & Inheritances

**mar 28**

personally excited for this topic because now I finally know more about classes - superclass, parents, and finally classes
the use of override is no longer confusing 
and the brackets next to classes (constructor) don't intimidate me anymore ~ 
learned a new word "abstract" that can be declared 

order (hierarchy!!) really does matter 
consistency is also v important - declared in one area, lateral declaration is required too ~
